This project is called Currency Conversion. In this project you can convert a certain amount of money to another currency. 
In the PostgresDB class we connect to our database. 
In the CurrencyRepository class we call the connection and choose which column we want to call and also count the conversion amount in it.
In the Currency class we can get as well as set data. 
In the Converter class, we have contact with user, i.e. work with the console. 
In the Main class, we have allocated memory for all the important classes and started the project.
